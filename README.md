Challenges: 

- There were honestly quite a bit of challenges. 
1. Time

Time was by far my biggest challenge. For the things that I wanted to do, it wouldn't be able to be done with the time frame and my skill level. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting issues in my JS and I should have taken a step back to regroup. I felt that the time allotted didn't allow me to deep dive research more than I wanted to. 

2. Planning

I typically feel that I'm a great planner. This project exposed to me that I don't have enough experience yet to anticipate how long things will take to complete. I need to build in troubleshooting time and looking things up further. 

During the planning processes, I should also type out pseudo code and makes sure I can accomplish all of those tasks using my pseudo code in the planning process. 

3. Nav Bar

Oy. 

4. Writing in the DOM. That's where most of my errors came from. 

Accomplishments: 

1. Separating sections of the document so that they were in different blocks! I'm happy I as able to use grid display! 

2. Better understanding of CSS. I have worked in CSS before in creating a stylesheet but I didn't understand all the options for properties and their values.
